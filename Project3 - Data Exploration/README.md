# (Ford GoBike Data Analysis)
## by (Ngenoh Kiprotich Nathan)


## Dataset

Ford GoBike dataset contains bike trips for the month of February 2019. The dataset has 183412 rows and 18 columns. 

## Summary of Findings

There are very few trips over the weekend in comparison to weekday. Bike Maintenance should be done over the weekends preferably early morning or late evening.

During weekdays, concentration of bike trips happens in the morning (between `7:00 AM and 9:00AM`) and in the evening (between `4:00PM and 6:00PM`). This is an indication that majority of bike riders (trips) use bikes to commute from home to work and from work to home. There is a noticeable decreased bike usage on weekdays between `10:00AM and 3:00PM`. Emergency bike maintenance can then be scheduled between `10:00AM and 3:00PM` on weekdays and anytime on weekends.

With exception of `Howard St at Beale St` and `The Embarcadero at Sansome St` stations, the top 10 start and destination stations features the same stations. i.e. These stations are both top as start stations and also top as destination stations.This validates the assumption that majority of trips are used for work commute. Riders start from one station in the morning and it becomes destination in the evening and vice versa for workers doing night shift.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Overally weekends have the least amount of trips in comparision to other days of the week. The trips taken over the weekend tend to be concentrated around mid morning to late afternoon, this is different in comparison to weekday where there is low number of trips taken during the same time period. Bike maintenance should be carried out during off-peak hours preferrabbly over the weekends.

Increase bike supply in top 10 start station during peak hours and ensure continuous bike clearance on top 10 destination stations during peak hours.

Majority of trips in the month of February 2019 were taken by male riders. When doing repairs or adding new bikes, emphasis should be laid on male specific bikes. Further research into the reason why other genders (`female` and `other`) are not using bikes frequently should be done. This is likely to open up new markets for GoBike business.
