# Udacity Projects under the `ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree Program`

# Introduction

I was privileged to be part of [ALX-T Program](https://www.alx-t.com/) scholarship for Udacity Data Analyst nanodegree. The course material was engaging and complex\advanced concepts have been unpacked to bits that make sense and are practical.

## ALX-T Program

ALX-T program offers fully funded scholarships geared towards transforming African Youth. The program focuses on In-Demand skills and sponsored by [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/) & Powered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

Upcoming and open scholarships can be accessed throught this [link](https://www.alx-t.com/catalog/)

## Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

The Data Analyst Nanodegree is a three month course taught using python programming language. The course covers topics in the categories below:

* Data extraction and preparation

Raw data is extracted from varying sources i.e. social media, scrapping the web, files etc. Tools used includes API's, [beautiful soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  etc,

* Data Analysis

Data visualization using pandas, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) were used to analyze data.

* Data Communication

Various techniques on how to communicate data findings are addressed. The techniques focus on reporting true position without misleading the audience or conveying the wrong message.

Students are also expected to benefit from career services through projects aimed at improving  professional branding on popular platforms i.e. LinkedIn and Github. Best practices and examples are showcased and special pointers raised on sections of interest. The course has vibrant community on slack and weekly zoom sessions on technical and career lead by session leads.

# Projects

As course requirements, three technical projects must be submitted addressing categories shown in bullet points above. These projects are reviewed by a panel of reviewers to ensure that they conform to course project rubric.

### [Project1 - Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/nateKiprotich/Udacity-Projects/blob/main/Project1 - Investigate a Dataset/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb)

In this project, I investigated `Tmdb Movie` data with the aim of answeing the questions below:
* Which Months are best/worst to release a Movie?
* Which Directors can deliver best performing movies ?

### [Project2 - Data Wrangling](https://github.com/nateKiprotich/Udacity-Projects/blob/main/Project2 - Data Wrangling/wrangle_act.ipynb)

In this project WeRateDogs tweets were analyzed using twitter api [tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/) and [request](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) packages to gather data.

Emphasis were laid on data cleaning\wrangling effort

### [Project3 - Data Exploration](https://github.com/nateKiprotich/Udacity-Projects/tree/main/Project3 - Data Exploration)

The third project of the course was on Ford GoBike data analysis. In this project, my aim was to find out day of week and time when bike maintenance can be undertaken.
